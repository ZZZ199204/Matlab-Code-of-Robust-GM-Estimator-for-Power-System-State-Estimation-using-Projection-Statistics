# Matlab-Code-of-Robust-GM-Estimator-for-Power-System-State-Estimation-using-Projection-Statistics
Here, we would like to share the Matlab code of the GM-estimator to all researchers. We also invite each of you to test the method and give us your feedback if you have any. The code attached is to implement the GM-estimator proposed by Mili in [R1]. The test systems include IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus and 118-bus systems. Only SCADA measurements are included. We have included detailed comments of the code.
